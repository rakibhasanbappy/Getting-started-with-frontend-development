      Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and
      "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually
      refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the
      Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries.
      In the US, as of 2019, these bananas, by poundage, are the most consumed
      fresh fruit.[9] By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit
      are called "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many
      more kinds of bananas are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is
      not as useful and is not made in local languages.

      The term "banana" is also used as the common name for the plants that
      produce the fruit.[3] This can extend to other members of the genus Musa,
      such as the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), the pink banana (Musa
      velutina), and the Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to members of the genus
      Ensete, such as the snow banana (Ensete glaucum) and the economically
      important false banana (Ensete ventricosum). Both genera are in the banana
      family, Musaceae.
