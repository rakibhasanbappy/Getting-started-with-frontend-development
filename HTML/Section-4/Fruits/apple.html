      An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp.,
      among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees
      are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the
      genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
      Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of
      years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European
      colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
      cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

      Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their
      parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics.
      For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars
      are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown
      without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after
      planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size
      of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. There are more than
      7,500 cultivars of apples.[3] Different cultivars are bred for various
      tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice
      production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest
      problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic
      means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on
      disease control and selective breeding in apple production. Worldwide
      production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting
      for nearly half of the total.[4]
