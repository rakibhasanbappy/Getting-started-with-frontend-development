# Getting-started-with-frontend-development

To learn frontend development, I have followed mdn learning guide. Here is the link to the guide: [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

## Table of contents

- Complete beginners start here!.
- HTML — Structuring the web.
- CSS — Styling the web.
- JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting.

Of course, it feels overwhelming to learn everything at once. But trust me, it's worth it. I have learned a lot from this guide. I hope you will too.

I don't have completed all the tasks given after every lesson. But I have tried to do as much as I can. I have completed almost all of the tasks given at the end of every module.
